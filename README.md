# START LEARNING PYTHON
## Step 1
Create your own git repository 
- open your terminal (e.g. gitbash) and add a directory with 'mkdir python-exercise'
- change into the created directory with 'cd python-exercise'
- type git init
## Step 2
- open your Github account 
- go to github dashboard
![create a new repository](/dashboard.png)
- a new window opens where you can add the Repository name
- for this exercise keep it public
- don´t add any features
- finally push the green button "Create repository"
## Step 3
- now you will see how to create a new repository on the command line
![create a new repository on the command line](/create-new-repo.png)
- in this example we are going to create a new repo on the command line
- follow the steps on github and type the commands into your terminal
- otherwise type the following:
    * 'echo "# python-exercise" >> README.md'
    * 'git add README.md'
    * 'git commit -m "first commit"'
    * 'git branch -M main'
    * 'git remote add origin git@github.com:yourname/yourfile'
    * 'git push -u origin main'
## Step 4
- create a feature branch for every task and start coding, after you solved your exercise you can merge the feature branch with the main branch
    * 'git checkout -b feature/python-basics' you create a new brach and change into the branch with one command
-create a new file
    * 'touch python-basic.py'
### Task 1
Write following code with python:
    * set a variable first_name with your first name
    * set a variable last_name with your last name
    * set a variable birht_year with your birth year as integer
    * set a varibale has_license with boolean (True/False)
### Task 2
Create a python programm which is doing math operations
    * Define two integers a and b with the value 10 and 3
    * Sum of a and b
    * Difference of a and b
    * Product of a and b
    * Integer quotient of a and b
    * Remainder of the division of a and b
    * Value of a high b 
### Task 4
Create a python programm which converts Celsius to Fahrenheit
    * the general formular is (F = 9/5 * C +32)   
### Task 5
Create a python programm which adds the Tax to the net price
    * in my example it´s 19 % Tax 

You will find a discription of the code I choosed within the code block.

Have Fun!
